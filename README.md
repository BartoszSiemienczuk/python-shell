# JBShell
JBShell is a simple shell written in Python. It was a simple learning project for me to understand how shells work. 
It is not meant to be used as a replacement for your current shell. It is a simple shell that can run commands and programs. It also has a few built-in commands. It is a work in progress and I will be adding more features to it.

## Features
* REPL
* Run executables from $PATH
* Built-in commands:
  * `type` to check if command is built-in or external
  * `exit`
  * `echo` to print passed arguments
